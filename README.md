# Incident-detection-with-traffic-data

Efficient  incident  detection  on  the  Strategic  Road  Network  (SRN)  is  a  demanding  task  that necessitates the development of incident detection tools.  This report proposes a framework to detectincidents on Highways solely by analysing the real-time traffic data.  The suggested incident detection algorithm has the potential to reduce the detection timeframe and provide early information for theemergency  response. This  is  particularly  needed  for  areas  like  major  A  roads,  where  Highways Englandâ€™s  intelligent  detectors  are  less  deployed.   Two  algorithms  are  proposed:  one  uses  simple Gassuain Distribution (SGD) and detects incidents based on the continuous outlier data; the otheruses Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to predict the distribution of normal time traffic flow andimplements the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) to extract anomalous data based on thetest  statistic. Algorithm  one  (SGD)  achieves  72%  and  50%  precision  on  the  training  and  testingdataset respectively and algorithm two (GPR-GLRT) sets thresholds to achieve 80% precision andachieved 61% precision in the testing dataset
